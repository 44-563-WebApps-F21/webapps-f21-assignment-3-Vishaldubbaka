<h1> Iron man </h1>

<p> Iron Man's standard offensive weapons have always been the repulsor rays fired from the palms of his gauntlets, 
    despite the suit's weapons systems evolving over time.The mono projector in its chest, an electromagnetic pulse generator, 
    and a defensive energy shielding that can be deployed up to 360 degrees are among the other weaponry integrated into various incarnations of the armor.
